How the LatticeFinder program works
===================================

This program is designed to help you obtain the optimal lattice constants for a 2D system (such as a graphene based system) or a 3D based system (such as a face-centered cubic lattice), as well as other parameters of the system with optimal lattice constants, such as the bulk modulus.
