Equivalently, press the $\\blacktriangleright\\blacktriangleright$ button to completely run this *Run_LatticeFinder.py* file from beginning to end. You can also find the $\\blacktriangleright\\blacktriangleright$ button in the menu bar above. Jupyter will display a box that will ask you if you want to restart the kernal.

For example, if you want to scan between a lattice constant of 3.0 Å to 5.0 Å in 0.1 Å segments, lattice_constant_parameters = np.arange(3.0,5.01,0.1). You can also have an irregular list. For example, if you want to look further between 3.8 Å and 4.5 Å in 0.01 segments, you can set lattice_constant_parameters = list(np.arange(3.0,3.8,0.1))+list(np.arange(3.8,4.5,0.01))+list(np.arange(4.5,5.01,0.1))\n",
    "    * If you are locating the optimal lattice constanta for a system that only contains two lattice constants, this must be entered as a list, where each key is the name of the lattice constant. For example, for a hexagonal closed packed crystal, you can set lattice_constant_parameters = {'a': np.arange(2.0,5.01,0.1), 'c': np.arange(3.0,6.01,0.1)}. The lists for each lattice constant must be regularly spaced; you can not use irregular spacing in LatticeFinder for system with more than one lattice constant.\n",
